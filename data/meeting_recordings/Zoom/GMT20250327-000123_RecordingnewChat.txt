00:14:10	Oren:	One way to clean the project if necessary is to gitingest the entire thing to Gemini Pro 2.5 Experimental through AI Studio (with over 2 million tokens in context) and ask for help in avoiding clutter/redundancy with YAGNI/DRY. It’s gonna find duplicate functions, tell you which files to remove and how to better organize it.

I used v0 for front end - I can send you the code!
00:22:15	Oren:	Replying to "One way to clean the..."

@Gil Probably Cursor, Just ask Gemini to refactor your code and follow the orders
The context is MASSIVE, so many things you can do with it
00:22:23	Nur asiah maryam:	Replying to "Did anyone play with…"
Yeah tried yesterday u can even create clean infographics now
00:23:03	Gil:	Replying to "Did anyone play with..."

Yeah, and it can handle/generate long strings and labels. It’s insane.
00:23:33	Oren:	Replying to "One way to clean the..."

pnpm install gitingest
gitingest —exclude-pattern=‘*lock*’

You’ll have a .txt file in your codebase, just drop it at AI Studio and ask it to do whatever you need

That's true, I chose Python for that reason only. But I really do not want to miss out on Typescript, will watch all videos after Bootcamp I guess after learning a bit of basics
00:52:33	kelseydilullo:	Have you guys noticed that when things are going well, it’s “the code” but when there is a bug, Cursor calls it “your code” 🤣 e.g. I’ll help you fix your code! thanks!

@Frederick Z, for debugging, I would suggest, don't ask cursor to debug ..tell it straight away don't solve it for me....but I think here is the problem, we will check that..also ask it to give you hints to think like a debugger...just learn debugging with llm
