      "name": "Gitingest with Gemini Pro 2.5",
      "described_by": "Oren",
      "description": "A technique to analyze an entire codebase by using gitingest to extract code and feeding it to Gemini Pro 2.5's large context window (2M+ tokens). The AI can then identify duplicate functions, suggest code to remove, and provide organizational improvements.",

      "described_by": "Tamilarasee S",
      "description": "A technique where you explicitly tell the AI not to solve debugging problems directly, but instead to provide hints and guide you through the debugging process.",
      "example": "Don't solve it for me, but I think here is the problem. Let's check that. Give me hints to think like a debugger.",
