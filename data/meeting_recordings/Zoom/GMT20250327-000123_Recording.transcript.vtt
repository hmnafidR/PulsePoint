00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.530
Meri Nova: Hello, guys.

2
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.309
Meri Nova: I I love how I just actually talked with you earlier today, with both, with both of you, too.

3
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.480
Meri Nova: What's up? Hi, Noor, I see. Yeah, I mean.

4
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.320
Meri Nova: Hi, autumn

5
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.960
Autumn Hicks: Thank you.

6
00:00:33.693 --> 00:00:43.506
Meri Nova: You know, the other day I was thinking, I'm gonna freaking, miss. You guys, we only have less than 3 weeks. But we already attached. I'm attached.

7
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.580
Meri Nova: Hi, Hi, Tamil! Hi, Fred!

8
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.009
Frederick Z: Hey! Hey!

9
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.879
Meri Nova: Let me remind everyone in the chat that we started.

10
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.580
Meri Nova: So Orin told me today that you guys cannot message each other.

11
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.320
Meri Nova: Is that right?

12
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.929
Autumn Hicks: Like in circle.

13
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.200
Meri Nova: Yeah. Like, DM, each other.

14
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.730
Autumn Hicks: Yeah, I've I've been able to. Yeah.

15
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.720
Meri Nova: Oh, really

16
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.359
Oren: I guess it depends on the initial, preferences, or whatever

17
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.779
Meri Nova: Oh, my goodness!

18
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.479
Oren: And then Kelsey couldn't. I think

19
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.839
Meri Nova: Huh! That's it. But I do. You have like a way to change that

20
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.700
Oren: Yeah, I, I was able to

21
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.135
Meri Nova: Okay. Okay. Okay.

22
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.979
Oren: I think not a lot of people know about this

23
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.573
Meri Nova: Yeah, I was like, Oh, my, gosh, that's like complete opposite of what I wanted.

24
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.655
Meri Nova: Great

25
00:01:48.400 --> 00:02:05.910
Meri Nova: alright, Hi says he's gonna be a few minutes late. But meanwhile share with each other and with me how? How it's been since the start of the week. How's it going with the tool use. Did you guys get to incorporate it, or maybe try out some sdks

26
00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:40.179
Frederick Z: Yeah, I think I got my tool used down. Heist advice about like like his advice about changing the system. Prompt. Where? Like you asked multiple times to to like use the tools. That really, that made a huge difference like I didn't even need to do anything. Fancy like a tinker with a tool function descriptions, or with a few shot prompting all I did was like repeat the request to use the tools at certain times, and that made a significant difference

27
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.440
Meri Nova: So it actually worked for you this time. I remember you were saying

28
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.529
Meri Nova: that it wasn't following the prompt. So you included in the system prompt in the tool, and where else in the main function, I guess

29
00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:16.799
Frederick Z: No, no, I think it was just the agent agent system prompt. I just repeated the the request. I didn't even know that that was the thing. But now I'm like I'm thinking about changing all my system prompts to to get it, to behave because you like like, you know, you know, when you when you put in the system prompt for for the agent or for the Llm. To either do something or not do something, and it doesn't

30
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:27.620
Frederick Z: anyway. Because it has a mind of its own. Now, I'm thinking I'm rethinking about the like, Re repeated. Asks why I didn't even know that was the thing. So until I talked about it. So

31
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.560
Frederick Z: yeah.

32
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.949
Meri Nova: That's so cool. That's so cool. You should tell him now, when he joins that he'll be happy to hear that.

33
00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:50.259
Meri Nova: Yeah, but I was. Also, you know what guys, since everyone is making so much progress. And the only way to share what you guys are building, it's usually through the Demos. But I've been thinking, why don't we? Now that everyone is learning on their own?

34
00:03:50.260 --> 00:04:16.009
Meri Nova: And why don't we? 10 x our learning, and actually let you guys show what you built? What kind of like challenges that you face? And how did you overcome it? Because that's how we ultimately learn from each other, and I know, like the format on General Chat does not allow you that much. So I was hoping to use this time as well to just like, if you guys, if some of you guys are up for it just to show like, what is your project right now?

35
00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.700
Meri Nova: What? How's it going? What are you guys building what maybe wins you already got? That would be that would be really cool.

36
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:32.769
Meri Nova: I think I texted you that autumn, because I know you're building a lot of cool things with web search. And I would like to hear from you guys, what are you learning from your experiments so far?

37
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.119
Meri Nova: Who let me know. Whoever wants to start maybe share their screen and walk us through

38
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.770
Meri Nova: anybody

39
00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.820
Autumn Hicks: Sure I I can go ahead and and show you guys if I can figure it out, hang on gonna share.

40
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.257
Autumn Hicks: Okay, you can't judge me for my! How many tabs I have open

41
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.710
Meri Nova: Owen.

42
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.369
Autumn Hicks: Okay. Can you see my browser

43
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.075
Meri Nova: I think we're waiting to. Okay. Cool now. Oh, my goodness.

44
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.635
Autumn Hicks: Okay, I usually don't use this browser. It's just for like testing. So

45
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:39.210
Autumn Hicks: actually. So I wanted to show you. Let's see, of course, when I show you guys, it's not gonna work this time. Okay, so here is the, this is what I was working on. The 1st 2 weeks is the lead search

46
00:05:39.540 --> 00:06:08.109
Autumn Hicks: so essentially when you add in the business name. And you know, business types of search, for it's using an AI agent with AI SDK, and it's going through like 3 different processes. So the web search function. And then I'm using a yelp, Api, and then Bing Api. So it's a lot, and I'm kind of tweaking it to see what the best solution is. But what I've been working on this week is going into these. Once the leads are found, you can actually, the user can save them.

47
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:18.480
Autumn Hicks: And this is actually from the. And of course, it's kind of jumbled because I have a bunch of test leads in here. But this is from the super base database.

48
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:44.328
Autumn Hicks: So these right here like, for just as an example. So these are actual like businesses. So then you can go up here and then start like the Aid research. And this is the second agent that I'm building right now. That's gonna actually use fire. Crawl to like, crawl the Urls for each of the leads. So it doesn't do anything right this second. But that's what I'm working on. And it's just setting up that

49
00:06:45.481 --> 00:06:51.420
Autumn Hicks: basically like crawling and then scraping for more information. So the next step in the process

50
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.970
Meri Nova: Hmm! That is so cool

51
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.630
Autumn Hicks: Yeah. Thanks.

52
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.029
Meri Nova: Oh, my goodness!

53
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.348
Autumn Hicks: How do I stop sharing? Hang on?

54
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.260
Autumn Hicks: Sorry.

55
00:07:01.193 --> 00:07:05.526
Meri Nova: Oh, here we go. Stop! Share. Okay, alright. We're good now.

56
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:26.290
Meri Nova: Thank you for sharing. That was so cool. Autumn. Hi! We were just like sharing each other's projects and the progress and learnings from the experimentation. So autumn was the 1st one to show. But I was also hoping autumn, like, what is your implementation like if you're comfortable sharing with your code, just walk

57
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.190
Autumn Hicks: Yeah.

58
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.990
Meri Nova: True. Yeah.

59
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.330
Autumn Hicks: Sure. Hang on, let me

60
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:40.359
Autumn Hicks: sorry I'm not super used to this. I'm in cursor right now, so give me a second share.

61
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:53.090
Autumn Hicks: I am I able to share this? Okay, yeah, okay, sorry. Here we go.

62
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.499
Autumn Hicks: Can you guys see this

63
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.180
Meri Nova: Yeah.

64
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:05.910
Autumn Hicks: Okay, cool. So, this is my project structure here. So I'm trying to pull up my.

65
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.670
Autumn Hicks: the 1st agent that I have. Let's see, where are you at?

66
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.389
Autumn Hicks: Of course I'm not gonna be able to find it this second.

67
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.179
Autumn Hicks: Hmm, hmm!

68
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:28.959
Autumn Hicks: This is kind of my my general overview here. I'm looking for my search agent. It's in here somewhere.

69
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.017
Autumn Hicks: No, no, no!

70
00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.622
Autumn Hicks: Sorry now that I now that I have.

71
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.240
Autumn Hicks: no, no, no! Now that I have it pulled up. I'm like trying to find

72
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.789
Meri Nova: Web search. Maybe it's under there.

73
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.258
Autumn Hicks: Yeah, yeah, yeah, let me, yeah, this is my test page.

74
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.444
Autumn Hicks: No.

75
00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:05.700
Autumn Hicks: yeah. I'll have to. I'll have to pull some stuff up to show you guys later. But this is the general. This is the general overview of what I'm working on here.

76
00:09:06.516 --> 00:09:09.329
Autumn Hicks: So and I have some of the I need to clean up this

77
00:09:09.947 --> 00:09:12.512
Autumn Hicks: really bad. But let's see

78
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:18.750
Hai: And search for like specific that usually

79
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.959
Autumn Hicks: That usually pulls it up. Okay, let's find it.

80
00:09:24.035 --> 00:09:28.870
Autumn Hicks: It is search business business agent.

81
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.619
Autumn Hicks: No, hang on.

82
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.930
Autumn Hicks: Sorry guys.

83
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:35.910
Meri Nova: All right.

84
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.880
Autumn Hicks: Where are you?

85
00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:41.490
Autumn Hicks: Business agents? How do I open this?

86
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.670
Autumn Hicks: Okay.

87
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.730
Hai: Search, go back to search, and then just delete where you says, enhance

88
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.019
Autumn Hicks: Oh, yeah, yeah, hang on.

89
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.850
Autumn Hicks: I was trying to replace digit business agents. This is the

90
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.340
Hai: Yeah, right? Click on that

91
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.785
Autumn Hicks: Yeah.

92
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.719
Hai: And then reveal in explore view

93
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:13.340
Autumn Hicks: There we go. Fantastic. Okay, perfect. So now, I can actually show you guys what it does. Okay?

94
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.330
Autumn Hicks: Sorry.

95
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.377
Autumn Hicks: Okay, can you guys see this now. Finally I found what I'm looking for

96
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.580
Meri Nova: Amazing. Yes.

97
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:36.679
Autumn Hicks: Yeah, so this is the business agent for the web search. So I have it going through 3 processes. So it's using a yelp Api bing! And then openai for web search. So

98
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.200
Autumn Hicks: up here.

99
00:10:39.120 --> 00:11:00.245
Autumn Hicks: And then this Serp Api is actually really cool. So it's like one and I only have. It's like it's paid. There's like a free version, but you can only do like a hundred searches a month. So, but instead of signing up for all these Apis, and you know you can just use one login, which is kind of cool. So

100
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.570
Autumn Hicks: this is the business. Search parameters. So this is where.

101
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:12.050
Autumn Hicks: let's see. You know, we're searching for city state address, zip code. All that stuff.

102
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:25.089
Autumn Hicks: I'm not as good as explaining the code as you are. I was about to say, there we go. So we're gonna find business, save it.

103
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.679
Autumn Hicks: Oh, this is another thing I had to add in there. I have it like batch

104
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:49.300
Autumn Hicks: batching because of the rate limits I was having issues when I 1st did this. It would just there would be a rate limit like every time I try to search for something. And so now it it does like, you know it like batches it, which is kind of cool. That took some troubleshooting.

105
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.820
Autumn Hicks: Yeah, it's like, just queuing. Let's see.

106
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.714
Autumn Hicks: trying to get down to like where it's actually doing stuff.

107
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:20.830
Autumn Hicks: Okay? So here's the steps. So this is where I was trying to get down to. So it goes through multiple steps. So it's gonna go to the yelp. Search 1st and then

108
00:12:21.522 --> 00:12:29.420
Autumn Hicks: business types, location, and then I have a radius, for you know, if I search a location and then it's like a 50 mile radius, for example.

109
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.630
Autumn Hicks: And then it will search process and then save the results.

110
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.120
Autumn Hicks: And then step 2. Is the Bing search

111
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.699
Autumn Hicks: same thing with the rate limits. That was an issue that I had to

112
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:50.610
Autumn Hicks: do, and then and then the 3rd step is directly do the web search for each business type. So at the end of the search

113
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.639
Autumn Hicks: which I can actually show you

114
00:12:55.130 --> 00:13:02.750
Autumn Hicks: hang on. Let me switch my screen really quick, and then I can show you how it works, and

115
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.290
Autumn Hicks: oh, never mind!

116
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.647
Autumn Hicks: Oh, hang on

117
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:15.056
Meri Nova: Sorry guys. Impromptu demo today.

118
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.430
Meri Nova: No, I just wanna give you kudos for stepping outside of your comfort zone.

119
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:30.779
Autumn Hicks: Sure. Yeah, yeah. The agents is, it's been really cool to play around with, and you know it. It wasn't working at all at 1st for me, and then I had to troubleshoot a lot, so

120
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.750
Meri Nova: Hmm, yeah.

121
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.440
Autumn Hicks: Yeah.

122
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.209
Meri Nova: Are you using Openai SDK, or Resell's SDK, for these

123
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.389
Autumn Hicks: Purcell

124
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:38.570
Meri Nova: Hmm.

125
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.650
Autumn Hicks: Yep.

126
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:40.770
Meri Nova: Pass.

127
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:41.240
Autumn Hicks: Yeah.

128
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.099
Meri Nova: For sharing. What's auto? What's your biggest learning this week? So far

129
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.200
Autumn Hicks: Oh,

130
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:55.752
Autumn Hicks: biggest learning this week. Honestly, it's been databases. So working with super base. I was having some issues with

131
00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:13.410
Autumn Hicks: like fetching. And then I'm not. I don't work in data so props to you guys who work with this stuff all day long, cause you know. Getting it to work was a little a little complicated, but I finally got it to work. It's finally fetching the database now, and it's you know, saving things correctly. So

132
00:14:14.657 --> 00:14:17.642
Autumn Hicks: yeah. So databases this week

133
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.619
Meri Nova: Great everyone. Let's

134
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.060
Autumn Hicks: Thanks guys

135
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:36.320
Meri Nova: Great job autumn. That's so cool. Yeah, no, this is great. How about anybody else wants to share what they built so far, and what they learned. So everybody else can learn

136
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:59.330
Frederick Z: I I actually had a question over that's somewhat related to autumn's project, and like, I guess I can ask autumn or Hi either either one. Also, I was just wondering like, how do you decide whether you wanna build you wanna use multiple agents or one agent that just calls multiple tools.

137
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:27.655
Frederick Z: either one like, you know. Either one can can tackle that. I know how how you describe that because I right now, I'm only using one like a 1 agent. But it calls like a multiple tools, like one of the tools is for web search and another tools for saving and retrieving memories from the vector database. So yeah, I don't use like separate agents for these. So I just use one. But

138
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:36.349
Frederick Z: but like, is there a yeah. I was, I was interested in your input. If you have like experience, we're doing both

139
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.489
Hai: Are you ask asking about? Multi agent versus one agent, many tools

140
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.500
Frederick Z: Yes.

141
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.590
Hai: Okay. Autumn. You go first.st

142
00:15:47.140 --> 00:16:03.040
Autumn Hicks: Sure. My project personally. I'm gonna use 3 separate agents. One for the search, one for enhancing, enhancing the data with the web crawling with fire crawl, and then the 3rd for the email

143
00:16:03.548 --> 00:16:17.129
Autumn Hicks: integration. So I was trying to just kind of stick with one main tool for each agent, but I don't know if that's the right answer. I just didn't want it to get too complicated. And so if something breaks, I know exactly what to fix personally.

144
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:27.610
Hai: Traditionally, traditionally, is around 10.3. Like, if you give an agent more than 3 tools, it'll just pass out and not do a good job.

145
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.910
Hai: That's why people start doing multi agents.

146
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:36.219
Hai: But nowadays, you have all sorts of things. You can do. Give many tools to an agent.

147
00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:44.739
Hai: You can do, vector retrieval to pick tool on the spot. If you have like 5,000 tools to give to an agent.

148
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.620
Hai: to do. Multi agent, it all comes down to

149
00:16:48.800 --> 00:17:02.808
Hai: having something to test easier. So it's easier to test an agent that can do like 3 different tools or 5 different tools compared to an agent that can do 1020 tools. It's really hard to test an agent that can do so many things like that.

150
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:20.330
Hai: so yeah, usually comes down to the preferences. And if you think the performance is not great, for, like a lot of tools, break it down to smaller agents. That's why the supervisor agent kind of pattern is always has always been like hot

151
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.261
Hai: I, personally would do

152
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:35.300
Hai: multi agent just because I can. At least I can test out, like an agent with 3, a set of 3 tools, 4 tools to compare as opposed to like a set of like 12 tools. It's much easier to test it that way.

153
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.110
Frederick Z: Okay. Cool. Thanks.

154
00:17:40.603 --> 00:17:45.850
Hai: The cat is just waiting for you to unmute yourself. That's so funny.

155
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.319
Hai: Cool! What what else are we doing today? Mary?

156
00:17:51.960 --> 00:18:00.779
Meri Nova: No, I just. I wanted to give a chance to people to share, you know, to share their learnings. And and of course, the questions as they come. But yeah.

157
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.723
Hai: Cool. Alright! That was a very impressive demo, I think.

158
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:22.833
Hai: I think you have a lot of stuff that I haven't talked about which which always impressed me. When people like go above and beyond. They're like, Oh, I built this and that, and I went, you know, and I had this idea that there's always this moment. So I've been teaching

159
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.400
Hai: people full stack development for the past 5 years, and

160
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:38.010
Hai: there are people from like all kinds of backgrounds. So they were like, ex military ex, you know, medical workers and carpentry and like trade

161
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:42.869
Hai: trade workers and stuff like that. And it's incredibly difficult to

162
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:47.869
Hai: kind of predict who's gonna go above, beyond it? In what way?

163
00:18:48.020 --> 00:19:09.590
Hai: And it it works the same way. It's almost like for me. It's so unpredict. It's so predictable for me now that that I'm like, I I can't tell you guys from this bootcam cohort who's gonna go above, beyond. But you. What you saw is an example of going above, beyond which is, you know, she she went to build all this stuff, and it's it's it's working. And

164
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:24.650
Hai: you know all of you had an idea about Mcp, right? You were like, you're not sure if you wanted to do it. But then I'm like, given your track record, you could probably figure it out, and then you will figure it out. So I think I think that's everyone should should follow.

165
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:31.659
Hai: Almost like, if if you feel like you want to build something within this day and age like it's just, it's not much, is holding you back from like

166
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.710
Hai: putting at least like a component or something out there

167
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.170
Hai: that that is working out right off the bat. So

168
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.718
Hai: I think that was a good example. Anyways. It's it's Q&A day. So

169
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.750
Hai: give me some cues

170
00:19:49.960 --> 00:20:10.080
Meri Nova: It can also be like something that you like. I like how orange is shared in the chat like the new tools that you're using. I know there's so many new models that are coming out, and people are very impressed with the Gemini pro 2.5. Also, too. Let us know if you're like trying out these tools because this is a dynamic field and we're all learning from each other as well

171
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.229
Hai: Who is using Gemini 2.0 pro right now.

172
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:24.640
Oren: I'm using the 2.5 right now, but I'm doing the experimental for free now. It's like 50 requests a day

173
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.069
Oren: that should do it

174
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.260
Hai: Do you find it to be super smart?

175
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:36.119
Oren: Extremely smart. I mean, the context is obscene. That's just dirty, like over 2 million tokens.

176
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.870
Hai: How many.

177
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.549
Oren: Over 2 million tokens. That's like too much

178
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.058
Hai: That's great. That's great, because,

179
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:51.279
Hai: you can fit like whole book in it, or in my case, I can fit like a whole like code base in it.

180
00:20:51.280 --> 00:21:04.880
Oren: Yeah, that that's exactly what I told the autumn, like in the chat like, just drop it in and ask ask it to like reorder it. It's gonna tell you what files you should remove, what files, what functions you should move to the other files.

181
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.669
Oren: It's like so useful. And with AI studio. It just makes sense

182
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:11.770
Hai: Yeah.

183
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:20.019
Hai: there's a youtuber that I don't know if they told you guys his name is.

184
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.970
Hai: And with convenience he's kind of like a

185
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.730
Hai: mentor to me in some ways.

186
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:39.210
Hai: But he's on like the he works with the Gemini team on a couple of different things, and he makes he always makes videos right right when they launch something. So

187
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.029
Hai: his his opinion is usually high quality. And I I do.

188
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.630
Hai: I do follow this guy. So

189
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.889
Hai: just drop the link to the chat.

190
00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.720
Hai: cool

191
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:18.519
kelseydilullo: Okay, I have a question if nobody else is okay. So this week I'm trying to think about the sort of like mind, map aspect of Scienceaurus. And I'm wondering, what tools can I use to like dynamically create kind of like a word rep or a dynamic diagram? As part of my app. You have any ideas for that

192
00:22:20.282 --> 00:22:26.610
Hai: When you say my map, my wind goes to like a chart almost like a flow chart.

193
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:31.206
kelseydilullo: Yeah, even similar to what you've been drawing like.

194
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:47.199
kelseydilullo: Excali draw just like. So let's say, I have the the keywords from an article, and there's like 6 keywords, and then I wanna I'll have similar articles right? So now I have, like some articles, share a keyword, and so I can link them through a keyword.

195
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:54.237
kelseydilullo: So I haven't really figured out what are going to be like the nodes of the diagram. But

196
00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:01.929
kelseydilullo: I guess I'm wondering if you know of any tools that it's almost like, I guess, a graph kind of like a graph display

197
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:09.719
Hai: Yeah. So I have an answer for you. It's not perfect. So on cats and bats. I have this thing where I can

198
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:25.739
Hai: look at like a diagram from a video frame and then replicate that in this thing called mermaid chart. So a mermaid chart is basically what you would see an Excali draw. It's like you got like notes, and you got like links between notes, and you can do like arrows and stuff.

199
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:42.430
Hai: large language models is not great at right at drawing Mermaid Chart perfectly. I always get broken charts, even though I, even when I give it like almost like a grammar or syntax that it can go off of. It's really hard for even

200
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:51.459
Hai: it's really hard for, like Gpt models and gemini models to do that, I think Claude also does a little bit better, but not perfect.

201
00:23:52.080 --> 00:24:05.590
Hai: So if you want to generate like a chart from Lm, it might not be perfect all the time. But if you already have the words, and you can like programmatically, create a chart, I think that's much easier.

202
00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:13.740
Hai: So what I use is what I use was, I think it's called mermaid. Js, yeah. So

203
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:19.539
Hai: if you if you make the An Lm. Draw the chart, it's

204
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:28.979
Hai: very hard to get it right. But if you already have the words, and then you can be like, Okay, so these are the words. And then I can just programmatically draw the lines.

205
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.029
Hai: and that's 100% doable.

206
00:24:32.472 --> 00:24:40.830
Hai: So I use mermaid chart. And I, I can like draw like stuff on the screen. I don't know if it's what you're looking for, but I can show you what it looks like real quick

207
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.370
kelseydilullo: Sure. Yeah.

208
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.670
Hai: Yes, let me share my screen. Here.

209
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.409
Hai: Are you using Nextjs

210
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.600
kelseydilullo: Yeah.

211
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:57.539
Hai: Okay, let me go to my app.

212
00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.010
Hai: And then, huh!

213
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.820
Hai: Who have a look at this. That's fun.

214
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:11.659
Hai: That's the go to authorize.

215
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.289
Hai: And I built this.

216
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:28.769
Hai: for example, this frame right here. It has, like a somewhat of a flow shot right here

217
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.350
kelseydilullo: So.

218
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.289
Hai: I think I have a flow chart that can display here. No, it's broken.

219
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.680
Hai: Yeah, this is why it's not perfect.

220
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.980
kelseydilullo: Is that X-ray, like part of a feature of cats with bats

221
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:48.980
Hai: Yeah. So see? So I was able to like draw this using mermaid. Js, and

222
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:56.370
Hai: if I can show you what the syntax for this looks like notes.

223
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:04.060
Hai: Maybe text name.

224
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:14.780
Hai: and then copy this over here to here. This is what is represented in the diagram like this is literally it.

225
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:21.420
Hai: Oh, it has graphs left to right. And then did they

226
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.039
Hai: let me get this this guy right here

227
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:27.690
kelseydilullo: Very cool.

228
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.430
Hai: Yeah, there's I don't know if that's what you're looking for.

229
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.819
kelseydilullo: Yeah, yeah, thank you. That gives me something to start with.

230
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:37.400
Meri Nova: It actually

231
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.399
kelseydilullo: That looks like super useful cats with bats

232
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.570
Meri Nova: No.

233
00:26:42.200 --> 00:27:00.819
Meri Nova: that's for sure. It just reminded me of the of another open source project that helps you visualize the Github Repos. They also use mermaid chart, but this is cool. I think this might be also useful for you, Kelsey. A friend of mine just shared yesterday. His.

234
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.420
Meri Nova: I can show you real quick. Maybe it's like

235
00:27:03.905 --> 00:27:07.010
Meri Nova: maybe this will be relevant for your project, too.

236
00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.570
Meri Nova: Desktop.

237
00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:20.199
Meri Nova: So so he's also an educator. He also creates things on Linkedin, and he just showed me yesterday, like

238
00:27:21.109 --> 00:27:27.050
Meri Nova: he wants to organize, for instance, your the material that you want to learn and let's say

239
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:47.589
Meri Nova: I don't know. I like this example, decorators, decorators, and what it does. So this tool might be useful for you. It generates, like like the chapters that are relevant to the main topic, and once you, for instance, press on one of them, it creates a branch in your tree

240
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:57.300
Meri Nova: so that you can see the the flow of just like your ui here. So it creates a new one.

241
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:06.149
Meri Nova: So he said that he's using react, flow. And you can integrate that with just whatever you're trying to generate here as well and

242
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.899
Meri Nova: see it here. So I guess this is more deterministic. In a way.

243
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:16.249
Meri Nova: this is called react flow. I have not personally used that, but this sounds this looks interesting.

244
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:17.910
Meri Nova: Check it out

245
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.460
kelseydilullo: Yeah, looks, similar.

246
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.640
Meri Nova: But yeah.

247
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.190
kelseydilullo: Cool.

248
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.039
kelseydilullo: Thank you. Thank you both

249
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.240
Meri Nova: Anyone else.

250
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.910
Hai: I was just waiting to see how long this silence would go on for

251
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.130
Oren: And I

252
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:58.929
Oren: about to ask, I was basically about to ask what Kelsey was asking like just regarding recipes. But that was perfect. And I'm gonna try it

253
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.239
Oren: and thank you

254
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:12.239
Autumn Hicks: I was gonna ask what Llm's models everyone is using for their projects and kind of why? Yeah, that was my question.

255
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.350
Oren: I think Gemini provides the best value in most cases.

256
00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:24.189
Oren: I mean, the context is massive, and you have the best value for money

257
00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:29.199
Oren: unless you need a specific use case, which case I can, I can tell you

258
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.720
Hai: Oh, you gotta say one more time because I was not listening. Say, one more time

259
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:44.680
Oren: I think that in most cases we should just like most of us, will probably use Gemini for the best.

260
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:47.300
Oren: A value value for money.

261
00:29:47.995 --> 00:29:55.329
Oren: but unless there's some specific use case that we should refer to, maybe Claude is better at some stuff.

262
00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.290
Oren: but most cases it just means gemini

263
00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.680
Hai: I agree.

264
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:04.790
Frederick Z: Beautiful.

265
00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:27.830
Frederick Z: I'm I'm sticking with open source for as long as I can, you know until I until I can no longer do so, and I'm sure if they're nowhere near as performant as gemini. But like until I actually deploy, everything is served on a llama

266
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.080
Hai: Nice

267
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:36.929
Oren: You. You can also use Gemma with an Api. It's all free, and you can use it for AI studio.

268
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.169
Oren: Also open source, by the way.

269
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.025
Oren: But I'm not a Google Ambassador, or anything

270
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.340
Frederick Z: Okay? No. Oh, okay. Did did you say Gemma or Gemma Nye?

271
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:52.549
Oren: No, Gemma. There's also Gemma that's open source and hosted by Google and Free

272
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.040
Frederick Z: Okay, all right, I will. I will definitely check

273
00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.159
Oren: Yeah, it's available at AI studio

274
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.470
Hai: Dwayne speak now

275
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.850
Dwayne Joseph: I am using gem Gemini 2 point. Oh, flash for

276
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:28.059
Dwayne Joseph: converting my design files into HTML and Css. When it comes to the code assistant. I was going to use Gemini. I'm building it currently now. I have the Ui set up working on the back end stuff, but

277
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:33.639
Dwayne Joseph: I'm pretty sure I'm going to use Gemini as well. Think about Claude, but

278
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.979
Dwayne Joseph: I don't know if there's 1 over the other that I should.

279
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.800
Dwayne Joseph: I should use it

280
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.089
Hai: Think you should try them all. I think that will give.

281
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:47.180
Hai: Think about your learning stuff right? So like, don't think about it from a perspective of.

282
00:31:47.310 --> 00:32:03.179
Hai: I try to squeeze the most amount of performance whatever you're learning stuff. So just just try them all. And then, if you don't like something about it that's actually really good, because then you have an opinion over it. Which is better than not having an opinion over these tools, because then, on your next project, you can just

283
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.740
Hai: dive right in and use the stack that you want and have a good reason for doing so.

284
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:13.739
Hai: Yeah, so even though here we're saying that you know Gemini is great, or whatever.

285
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.090
Hai: If you want to use grok, just go and use it like

286
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:17.750
Dwayne Joseph: Yeah.

287
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:40.309
Dwayne Joseph: actually had a huge issue that I never really shared. But so my original idea was to be able to convert Photoshop files, figma files and Xd files into code, because that's what we get at my job. However, no AI actually takes those files. I had to

288
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:56.220
Dwayne Joseph: either convert them in my app like, convert those files into like a photo, like a like a jpeg, or like a Png file, or I had to just give give the AI, an image file. So that was a huge kind of

289
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:11.190
Dwayne Joseph: hurdle that I kind of had to go over. And the problem with that is that in Photoshop files and fig files and Xd files, you actually get things like font sizes, fonts, things like that. And these vision models can't really.

290
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:20.100
Dwayne Joseph: most of them can't really tell what font you're using or what you know. And and so it was kind. It's kind of tricky. I didn't know how to

291
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:25.939
Dwayne Joseph: really go like, fix that issue. If that makes sense. Yeah.

292
00:33:26.276 --> 00:33:33.009
Hai: So were you able to find like a library somewhere that can read Photoshop files and get you the metadata

293
00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:35.409
Dwayne Joseph: No, no.

294
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:44.119
Dwayne Joseph: no! I well, what I what I looked for was, I think it's called a Ocr. Like optical Ocr models that

295
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:51.109
Dwayne Joseph: could read font sizes, and some of them can, but they're not that good at.

296
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.440
Dwayne Joseph: Yeah, I wouldn't. I wouldn't.

297
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:52.820
Dwayne Joseph: Goes

298
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:53.939
Hai: My money on that

299
00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.830
Dwayne Joseph: Yeah.

300
00:33:54.830 --> 00:34:04.169
Hai: If you can extract that. If you could extract that, what does a Psd file look like? Let me see, I'm I'm actually curious. Now, what does a Psd file look like

301
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.480
Dwayne Joseph: I can. Sh! I can.

302
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:20.629
Dwayne Joseph: It's it's basically very similar to like even a figma file. The thing is, you can click the font. Let's say you have a design, right? You have an email. And I want, like as a designer or a developer. I have to. You know.

303
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:39.460
Dwayne Joseph: figure out what font it is. All I have to do. All I can do is click on it. Kind of like a word document, right? If you want to know what the font is. You could just click the font or the word, and it'll tell you the font in the corner. Tell you the font size, the color, everything like that. A image won't do that. You see what I'm saying. The image is just an image. You can't really click the

304
00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.220
Dwayne Joseph: the contents of it. So

305
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.939
Dwayne Joseph: I was. Kinda I didn't know how to get around that

306
00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:51.990
Hai: Alright! Alright! I pop my screen here, let's do this together.

307
00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:52.839
Dwayne Joseph: Okay.

308
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.439
Hai: Mpm package to read. Esd.

309
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.069
Hai: there's a parser right here. Psdrjs.

310
00:35:03.897 --> 00:35:09.620
Hai: it gives you document structure document size on data. I'm sure that you need this right

311
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.570
Dwayne Joseph: That's what I need

312
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:37.569
Hai: So what you can do is you can use like a gemini model like 2 point. Oh, Flash! To do like to understand the layout right? And then you can extract the font size and other stuff. You can stuff that in the prompt and be like, hey, this is what the layout looks like. And then here are the precise like a description of like what the font should be, and what font family should be, which you don't honestly, you don't need to put this.

313
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:47.290
Hai: I'm I'm trying to think if you should even need to put this into the Lm. To generate it, or you can insert these in after the Lm has has generated all the stuff.

314
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:54.270
Hai: And then you can just kind of like programmatically insert these these details in, because these are hard coded numbers right?

315
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.210
Hai: But to make it super easy.

316
00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:07.360
Hai: get the information out of the Psd file and then stuff that into the prompt after the Ocr part and be like, okay. You know, the

317
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:13.380
Hai: the layout should look like this, but then the numbers are like this, and then hopefully, that will help

318
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:34.469
Dwayne Joseph: Helps a lot, should I? Would you recommend sticking to one type of file? Then? Maybe like a Psd, because different clients send the creative in different ways. Some might prefer Psd. Some might prefer figma files, should I? But for my project, should I just stick to one

319
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:35.680
Dwayne Joseph: type of file

320
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:43.900
Hai: Hmm!

321
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:56.310
Hai: I think this is to call the click my Api or something. Yeah, this is not what you're looking for.

322
00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:02.649
Hai: So when you say, Figma File, do you mean like a file that is shared over like a link

323
00:37:03.316 --> 00:37:10.440
Dwayne Joseph: It's it's a downloadable file, just like a image. It's literally I think it's a dot fig file. So it's literally a file

324
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.460
Hai: Oh, wow!

325
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:14.330
Hai: I've never seen anyone download a figma file before.

326
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.475
Dwayne Joseph: Yeah, it's like a figma file that you can download

327
00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:28.430
Dwayne Joseph: But I do think it's all I do think that there's also a link for it. I don't use figma like that. I just know that there, this is a type of file that creative

328
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.899
Dwayne Joseph: or clients make for their creative

329
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:39.360
Hai: Okay? Let's see uploading assets.

330
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.580
Hai: Let's see.

331
00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.870
Hai: let's the pn.

332
00:37:53.090 --> 00:38:02.639
Hai: pick my files, everything. But every file thing that consists of true notes. Okay, global properties.

333
00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:07.630
Hai: Okay, no types. Okay?

334
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.300
Hai: I guess if the file has some sort of like identifiable

335
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:19.690
Hai: information about it, you could probably hit up the Api and

336
00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.722
Dwayne Joseph: Okay, info or something

337
00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.510
Hai: Font

338
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.986
Dwayne Joseph: I think what I'll do is I'll focus because my client we use

339
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:34.409
Dwayne Joseph: Xd adobe Xd, I don't know if you heard of it very similar, Photoshop.

340
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:40.919
Dwayne Joseph: I think I'll stick to just that or Photoshop either, or but I think cause my client right now

341
00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.670
Dwayne Joseph: uses these type of files

342
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.730
Hai: Yeah, 10.

343
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.610
Hai: Hmm, that's cool.

344
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.389
Hai: So yeah, I think Psd is probably the easiest

345
00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:07.650
Dwayne Joseph: Okay, I'll I'll do. Psd. Then sounds good

346
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:17.440
Hai: payment.

347
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.040
Hai: The

348
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:30.070
Hai: is this like a universal file metadata thing.

349
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.380
Hai: I wonder if you can even get that straight out of like any file.

350
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:43.469
Hai: Anyways, yeah.

351
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:47.130
Dwayne Joseph: Can you send me the that you went that you said

352
00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:52.850
Hai: Yeah, yeah, yeah, let me double check. This is, is this like a popular one?

353
00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.879
Hai: Yeah, it's pretty popular.

354
00:39:55.430 --> 00:40:01.700
Hai: But it hasn't been updated for a long time. So 4 years

355
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:03.540
Dwayne Joseph: Wow!

356
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:09.220
Hai: So let's see, history that Rb has from B.

357
00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:14.920
Hai: This one also hasn't been updated since 10 years ago.

358
00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:22.859
Hai: So not necessarily like a super popular use case. I imagine

359
00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:31.779
Hai: But let's see, you are still using it.

360
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.749
Hai: But you can have it. I

361
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:45.119
Hai: I think what teams usually do is if this is super useful for them. They'll probably fork it, and then they'll develop this further in house.

362
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.120
Hai: But here, let me send it to you.

363
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:51.850
Hai: Boom

364
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.799
Dwayne Joseph: Thank you. Huh!

365
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:18.720
Sarthak 13: Okay, Hi, I have a like a question in general. The question is like, are there any good resources for? You know. Llm system design, like, you know, like building applications and end to end system designs or something

366
00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.800
Hai: Resources for building end-to-end. Llm. Application.

367
00:41:29.845 --> 00:41:32.900
Hai: Do you have a particular problem in mind that you're trying to solve

368
00:41:33.687 --> 00:41:38.830
Sarthak 13: It would be. Let's say text to SQL. Use case

369
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:41.689
Hai: Okay,

370
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:50.330
Hai: do you have any opinions about what tech stack you want to use to solve that or

371
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:53.150
Hai: any more context around what you're trying to solve

372
00:41:54.226 --> 00:42:01.653
Sarthak 13: So basically, if someone has, let's say, like their own data warehouse, like schemas where there are

373
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:07.870
Sarthak 13: 20 tables, and they want to write the

374
00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:20.089
Sarthak 13: like, write in English, and then the application would convert it to SQL. And write a query. So something like that, for, like a small data set, maybe 1015 tables.

375
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:26.940
Hai: Okay, some quick examples. Langchain has a tech to SQL agent

376
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.329
Hai: example that you can look up on Google.

377
00:42:30.027 --> 00:42:33.599
Hai: If you if you want to see something in production. I know

378
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.490
Hai: neon has one neon neon the database company

379
00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:43.750
Hai: and super base also has one. I know

380
00:42:44.211 --> 00:42:50.870
Hai: data bricks, and you go to databricks. There's 1 that you can use to query stuff it's

381
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.010
Hai: and yeah, that's like a

382
00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.339
Hai: crazy ton of text to SQL.

383
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:04.830
Hai: Resources. I, I can blocks and stuff online if you just Google it.

384
00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:10.260
Hai: I don't personally have a opinion on it, because I personally feel like

385
00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.637
Hai: Texas sequel only gets complicated when you talk about the

386
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.160
Hai: like when when you have like a lot of tables and

387
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.309
Hai: your query gets complicated, then you might have issues. But

388
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:29.869
Hai: from my personal experience, if you just throw the tails definition into your your prompt.

389
00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:34.880
Hai: it usually can do a pretty good job, especially with like a frontier model like Claude.

390
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:43.810
Hai: So from my perspective for small projects, it's a solved problem for enterprise level. Probably not.

391
00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:50.270
Hai: But then enterprise enterprise needs are very unique right. Every every enterprise is kind of like a snowflake.

392
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:56.599
Hai: you know. So unless we have details here, I can't speak more on on that

393
00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.180
Sarthak 13: Okay.

394
00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.250
Hai: Yeah.

395
00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:06.949
Meri Nova: By the way, I think it's the 1st time I probably see you at the Live Sessions. Is that true? And if so, welcome

396
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.050
Sarthak 13: Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.

397
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:11.820
Meri Nova: Cool, cool. Good. Is it good to see you here

398
00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.020
Sarthak 13: Yeah,

399
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:19.456
Sarthak 13: Next time I'll switch on the video. So you can like, actually see me. But yeah, okay.

400
00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.189
Meri Nova: Hey? How? How? How's should we start calling names, or what? Hecta, you're you're trying to speak

401
00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.340
Ekta: Yeah, yeah.

402
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:45.259
Ekta: So yeah, coming from, I, I just have a Mlm competition background, particularly working with models and modeling

403
00:44:45.400 --> 00:45:09.520
Ekta: like designing model and stuff like that. So software design is not my strongest suit. And I am like stuck like, there's a lot of processes going on like starting from searching the papers assembling them, querying them, and putting them database, and again summarizing them. So all this 1st part is still easy to, you know, capture, and I'm understanding, how do I

404
00:45:10.117 --> 00:45:16.660
Ekta: save it and use it for further use? Because I want to attach this with per user, like, how is a user.

405
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:29.749
Ekta: actually querying and saving the required resource. Articles stuff like that. But the the last part that's writing with the help of the summary that the writing tool

406
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:48.260
Ekta: like I'm I'm kind of wrapping my head around it like what would actually happen? Because, I'm I'm right now stuck like I'm not use any agent development on this project yet. So how should I? Am I not seeing something? How should I interpret this going forward? And

407
00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:53.929
Ekta: like? What exactly would happen with writing like. I understand that

408
00:45:54.550 --> 00:46:00.310
Ekta: Llm. Would help me write the research summary of the articles and

409
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:06.280
Ekta: take me forward. But, like with all of these processes going on like it's it's just being confusing for me. So

410
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:09.730
Hai: Yeah.

411
00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:12.320
Ekta: Yeah, that's the situation of the question. Yeah.

412
00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.389
Hai: Cool. Yeah. Can you? Can you ask it one more time? Because I got a little bit confused

413
00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.179
Ekta: Yeah, yeah, it's

414
00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:24.140
Hai: I have like, I have like 2 brain cells left. It's like 8, 47 pm. But please ask again.

415
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.940
Ekta: Yeah, yeah, it's kind of situation more than a question, I guess. So. Since I don't have an

416
00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.760
Hai: It's an event. Okay, let me let me turn on that part of my brain. Okay, go ahead.

417
00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.230
Ekta: Yeah.

418
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:38.180
Hai: I'm listening.

419
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:53.640
Ekta: So yeah, so more of because the project has a lot of processes like I can tackle one by one. And I have pretty much figured out what happens in the 1st part like searching and then analyzing them.

420
00:46:54.209 --> 00:47:01.989
Ekta: Summarizing the articles, etc. But the the main part that's writing a report based on that, so that

421
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:23.369
Ekta: the user can have access to the articles. Write the report immediately so that they don't have. You know, there's some contact between summarizing and writing the research direction. So I'm just just lost, like, how do I like, put this process together and like the pieces together, and

422
00:47:23.961 --> 00:47:28.600
Ekta: think of some solid design like, because design is not my strongest suit, like

423
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.540
Hai: Oh, yeah.

424
00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.180
Ekta: Bye.

425
00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:31.520
Hai: A failure.

426
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:33.849
Hai: Yeah. But have you tried so far

427
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:35.930
Ekta: What was that?

428
00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.660
Hai: What have you tried so far?

429
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:48.660
Ekta: So I am trying like there's today. I was just trying to keep one unified agent, because I never like. I was just trying a very simple workflow way, just to understand, like my blog diagram

430
00:47:48.800 --> 00:48:09.285
Ekta: and trying to call process one by one. I have not included a lot of asynchronous design, or like a lot of tool calling because I need to 1st understand what exactly. I'm me as a person I can't just, you know, wipe code and keep it aside. I have to keep on understanding one by one, because I'm learning it right? I'm I'm new to software engineering and design. So

431
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:30.990
Ekta: so by learning this, I I just get lost in one process and just lose the context of what I want to do next. So this learning part engaging with that learning part, and then also thinking, How do I exercise this agent? So right now, I just thought a very simple way like kept a unified agent. That's just

432
00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:54.360
Ekta: helping us search and maybe rewriting the query in order to search a better publication or article, and then saving it into a database per user wise. So I was also stuck in that way like, should I save as a Json? Or should I just keep the abstract your publication safe. But I figured out

433
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.869
Ekta: some of that.

434
00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.400
Ekta: The next process that's haunting me like, would I be able to complete the writing tool part?

435
00:49:02.042 --> 00:49:08.489
Ekta: Or should I just stick to the 1st process from searching to analyzing, filtering, and summarizing.

436
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:13.170
Ekta: and just complete this for the boot camp? Like.

437
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.390
Ekta: So

438
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:21.310
Hai: Okay, if if you were to, if either way works out perfectly, which one would you go with

439
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:22.990
Hai: either way

440
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:28.969
Ekta: You can accomplish it, because that is the foundation of the project. Like, to begin with,

441
00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:44.640
Ekta: searching, summarizing, and accumulating the very important stuff, the relevant stuff I exactly need. And so that the the user at least has a direction of the research like, what's the research gap? Because that's the main focus of my project. Like.

442
00:49:44.730 --> 00:50:09.650
Ekta: exactly, was the research gap. Like, of course, there's a lot of materials available. But what I'm trying to do. So I want to figure out the direction like, because as a user like I have seen in the research space, like, what happens is the researcher would get lost and would not get to the ultimate goal. And the direction is not as straightforward. So that is what I wanted to solve this problem

443
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:17.629
Ekta: like having the right summary together. And you know, quickly analyzing what's going on and then moving forward to the research direction.

444
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:24.829
Ekta: So I would like to establish the foundation part. That's summarizing exactly what I need

445
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:29.900
Ekta: and like. If I wanted to do, I would rather focus on that. So

446
00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:36.350
Hai: Yeah. Next step, what? What we like, the next small step that you can take to get there

447
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.120
Ekta: Like, I want to store the relevant information

448
00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.769
Ekta: into a database that is easily accessible.

449
00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:48.320
Ekta: And so, yeah.

450
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:52.039
Hai: Let's do that. Then you gotta do that, and then let me know when you're done.

451
00:50:52.755 --> 00:50:59.340
Ekta: I'm still thinking like it's it's very I don't know. It just gets a lot but

452
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:07.820
Hai: I know. I know this is why this is why some of us are sipping extremely fast and others are not, and if you want to break into.

453
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:13.490
Hai: Here's the thing. So some people have stronger tendencies to overthink than others.

454
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:22.150
Hai: Either way, like a month from now. I wouldn't say a month from now, 2 weeks from now.

455
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.989
Hai: Do you want to see something

456
00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:32.560
Hai: that you've built? Or do you want to see a diagram? That's what I'm trying to say so. Either way, it's it's it's still. Gonna you're still gonna be left with the the

457
00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:40.430
Hai: the problem that you know. You gotta think through like the the best possible architecture for what you're building.

458
00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:41.330
Hai: but

459
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:41.850
Ekta: And

460
00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:48.109
Hai: And again, like nobody's gonna hold you accountable for this like, we're all just strangers on the Internet. Right? So

461
00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.310
Hai: I'm I'm telling you like

462
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:51.779
Oren: Not any problem.

463
00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:56.830
Hai: If you're relying on me, if you're rely on me to tell you what to do.

464
00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.630
Hai: I can't. I want you to understand that

465
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:04.060
Hai: after this boot camp. If you can get over this hurdle of like.

466
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:13.500
Hai: get over yourself, you would do so well when you're shipping stuff really fast and like make decisions faster. So, Hecta, this is like.

467
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:19.756
Hai: and in time, when you, when you become a developer.

468
00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:21.350
Ekta: One second.

469
00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:22.059
Ekta: No, I think I

470
00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:22.850
Hai: Vancoder.

471
00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:23.780
Ekta: Good

472
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:49.100
Ekta: like I I according to my because I'm very new to, of course, like I said, like system development. But according to that like I was able to quickly web scrape, and, you know, call the Apis asynchronously. And I'm not using 3 different like I'm using different Apis. But right now I'm able to call like what whatever I need, the most frequent needed and stuff like that. So so

473
00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:59.700
Ekta: I think I'm able to grasp quickly. It's just that. I also took a difficult route, like maybe the typescript route and understanding the code and like

474
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:05.980
Hai: Take that. Listen. We're all watching. We're all watching. I know exactly what you're doing, and I remember what you said in the beginning. So

475
00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:10.929
Hai: that's why I'm trying to like. I'm trying to push you a little bit, because I know you can do it. So

476
00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:21.699
Hai: you you overthink stuff right? But you gotta. You gotta. You gotta get over that. And I know you can and I know you're thinking because you're putting in work. It's just that it's working your head.

477
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:28.950
Hai: What I should I want you to do is put an initiative into like, just just build something concrete like a slice. We talked about a slice in the beginning. Right? So

478
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:35.540
Hai: you all the stuff that you're thinking about right now that count as work that's not wasted time. By the way

479
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:38.879
Hai: like you're not wasting time you're you're

480
00:53:39.260 --> 00:54:06.470
Hai: you're getting over yourself, and that's that's great. So don't think about like all the time that you like overthinking. These make them the best stories when you go on into interviews, when you go and talk to like a team somewhere else, because then they can relate to that. And they're like, Oh, we had the same issue here, and well, how did you do it? And then you can tell the story like, oh, I did this, and then kind of kind of done happens so many times in my career and other people's career as well. I think

481
00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.819
Hai: there's a shortcut to this. So

482
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:19.050
Hai: the fact that you're struggling through it, it's it's supposed to be hard like for people who overthink it's supposed to be hard and people who are new, and you decide to do typescript, even though you don't know if typescript so kudos to you.

483
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.230
Hai: What I need you to understand is that it's not gonna be hard forever.

484
00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:26.050
Hai: One day you're gonna get over this and you're gonna ship something, and then

485
00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:28.530
Hai: you won't even remember it today.

486
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:30.810
Hai: And I know you can do it.

487
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:33.699
kelseydilullo: So I want to share something. I feel like this will help.

488
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:41.279
kelseydilullo: Okay. So there is this scientific thing. Where, when you're if you go for a walk

489
00:54:41.520 --> 00:55:08.979
kelseydilullo: or running, or something that activates both sides of your brain. And you're thinking about something you're processing while you're activating both sides of your brain. So you have your logical and your creative side so literally what I do. It sounds crazy, but I don't care. I will go for a walk. I'll put in headphones, and I will talk to myself, and I will describe the issue, and then I will like brainstorm, and by the time I'm done with my walk. I'm like, all right, I know what to do next. So I feel like if you get stuck, which I currently am.

490
00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.069
kelseydilullo: try that.

491
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:16.459
kelseydilullo: Go for a walk, talk to yourself, and it will activate both sides of your brain in order to like problem, solve better

492
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:18.819
Meri Nova: That's awesome.

493
00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:19.920
Meri Nova: Yeah. And also

494
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.130
kelseydilullo: Also, I feel like Week 3 is really hard. I want to say that like I feel like this is like a

495
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:40.170
kelseydilullo: I don't know, like I'm having the hardest week. So I don't know if anybody else is having a really hard time with Week 3. But I feel like we're you're like over the initial like, this is so cool. And now you're like, you still have to like push through the hard part. I guess this is why you guys said, choose something that you really like, because we get stuff.

496
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:42.800
kelseydilullo: Okay. Now, I'm done and rant

497
00:55:43.560 --> 00:56:07.590
Meri Nova: No, this is great. This is perfect. Ecta. I just wanted to share with everybody that the project that you submitted on the 1st Demo. It's mind blowing, and congrats again for choosing the hard path. And if you are okay with this, I can share and remind people how much progress you made in the 1st week, just to show you that sometimes you think you're not doing the progress, but you are.

498
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:22.009
Meri Nova: and also when you do keep like overthinking. I think it's important to get back to the user problem. If, especially like, when you're trying to decide what to do next. I think it's important to get back to like, okay, what's the problem we're trying to solve with your app.

499
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:38.800
Meri Nova: And it seems like, maybe it's time to talk to the users. Maybe it's time to like share it with somebody else. Of what? What? Maybe what you think is valuable. Other thing is not. Maybe there's something else for you to discover. But either way, this whole process is all about just trying and trying, and failing, and learning

500
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:41.659
Meri Nova: and sharing with everybody else. So.

501
00:56:41.740 --> 00:57:08.010
Meri Nova: and Kelsey said it wonderfully like if you, if you get stuck, there are so many ways to like, get unstuck, and we're here for it, like, thank you for sharing also. This is this is very valuable, what you're sharing, and it looks like on the chat. Many people are sharing this similar sentiment as well, it's it's not easy. Guys like, imagine this, you're learning typescript. In 2 weeks it's crazy. People were dedicating months and years. I mean, Hai was teaching that

502
00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:15.499
Meri Nova: for people in like 6 months to cover what you're covering now. So it's totally okay to feel overwhelmed. And I talked earlier

503
00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:16.649
Hai: That's true. That's true.

504
00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:36.009
Meri Nova: Dwayne with Oren as well earlier today, and Orin's been saying like he's not sleeping. He's like 24, 7, trying to debug stuff. So same with Dwayne, like they show up on the vibe, coding sessions and asking lots of questions. So this is part of the learning journey, and you're doing great Ecta.

505
00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:47.029
Hai: So that's such a good point, because for the full stack boot camp that I've been teaching for the past 5 years. It used to take somebody 6 months to a whole year to like build something

506
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:54.649
Hai: in like react and no js, express and all that stuff. And this is pre AI

507
00:57:55.192 --> 00:58:03.330
Hai: since, you know, Chat Gpt got popular, we have to change our strategy so that our students are using AI tools more, which also expedites the

508
00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.839
Hai: the time that they they would take to build and complete a project.

509
00:58:07.633 --> 00:58:12.630
Hai: So when you're stuck into details, just zoom out.

510
00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:20.369
Hai: you're in the perfect. You end up the best time in our lifetime so far to create something and to be able to build the stuff in like

511
00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.969
Hai: 5 weeks has. It's impossible before. It's literally impossible.

512
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:30.540
Hai: But you're doing it. And it's supposed to be hard. And this is what hard feels like.

513
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.140
Hai: Yeah.

514
00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:41.210
Ekta: I mean, I am very proud because for my 1st time in life I am doing whatever I'm doing

515
00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:50.079
Ekta: like like scrolling so many apis together thinking of the database thinking of authorization. And also

516
00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:55.359
Ekta: I mean, I'm happy. But yeah, things are a little slow on my end. I feel

517
00:58:56.150 --> 00:59:00.190
Hai: Yeah, Hector, I need you to push a little bit more. I need you to push a little bit more. You can do this.

518
00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:02.650
Hai: It's where I got like, 3 weeks from now.

519
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:06.604
Hai: you're gonna pull this off. And then we're gonna we're gonna

520
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:13.470
Hai: blow up your project everywhere, basically because we're we're gonna be very proud of you. Everybody on this call is, gonna be very proud of you.

521
00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:17.390
Hai: because now you've been yapping for the past 2 min, I don't care, but

522
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:24.259
Hai: and not everybody knows what the problem is, and not everyone's gonna be watching you right? This girl who didn't know typescript

523
00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.570
Hai: but didn't choose didn't choose python.

524
00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.019
Hai: That's courty in itself. So

525
00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:41.150
Hai: whatever you do from this point on, you gotta look back and be like I I was that girl who chose touch gear over python. So whatever it comes in my way, I can tackle it. Gotta remember that.

526
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:48.100
Hai: Okay, don't start crying on my zoom. Okay, just kidding.

527
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:49.580
Hai: Buy all you want.

528
00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:55.701
Meri Nova: Kelsey is saying, it's a QA. And event session. Love it

529
00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:22.630
Meri Nova: cool. Yeah. And I feel like, feel free guys like who are like spending a lot of time or an autumn. Dwayne. I literally see you on every vibe session like, Please speak up. You guys are like now responsible because you are showing up. And there are many people that want to get inspired and see the progress that you guys are making. And I think it's on your responsibility to to share and share what worked and what hasn't.

530
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:32.300
Meri Nova: And I'm not saying it's only you guys, I know there are people that are working different time zones. But whoever is getting ahead please share with others as well. It's time to support each other

531
01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.830
Oren: I'm gonna do it the 1st time. The code isn't broken. Once I'm on the call

532
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.420
Oren: the 1st time it's not broken, I'm gonna do it

533
01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:43.950
Hai: Very nice.

534
01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:54.840
Hai: and I just wanna add one more thing. So I'm not sure I'm not doing lip service here like Ector. If you just start messaging me on on circle like DM. Me as you could progress, and then I will

535
01:00:55.010 --> 01:01:01.770
Hai: personally see if, wherever you need help with, I'll I'll make sure that I'll look at into it like thoroughly.

536
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:04.489
Hai: just for you.

537
01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:22.960
Ekta: Yeah, I just want your help, where I could see something which I'm not seeing. So I'll start sharing on the demo day, maybe if I so I just need some direction in that, because sometime like like, Mary said, you can't see things and people can. So

538
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.459
Ekta: I want to take advantage. Yeah.

539
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:38.490
Meri Nova: That's actually a good idea on the Demo Day guys, it's not only about showing off what you build, but also time like for you to share what you're struggling with big time, and it's another opportunity to get unblocked. So keep that in mind.

540
01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.510
Meri Nova: Awesome. Anything else. Yeah, Melissa, go ahead

541
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:51.329
Melissa: Yeah, I'll share something. I had a revelation earlier.

542
01:01:51.560 --> 01:02:21.010
Melissa: I've been doing get commits like crazy. And this is my 1st time using get, for, like the active project. I was just committing stuff like here and there over the months and years. So I realized I'm like, Oh, I started reading, like all of the text. And I was, it's a private repost, or whatever. But I was committing like my computer username. And I'm like, oh, no, this is a cyber security risk. So I went and updated that and fixed it

543
01:02:21.747 --> 01:02:31.899
Melissa: but it just made me like come back to the fact that I'm like, okay, once I get to a certain point, I'm gonna slow down and do like a security

544
01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:44.569
Melissa: like Sweep, because I've seen like I see horror stories and everything else nowadays about different security vulner vulnerabilities. And being that I don't know.

545
01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:58.140
Melissa: you know the explicit details of them. I'm like, okay, let me create like a little checklist and make sure my dB is good, and it's not susceptible to certain type of vulnerabilities and and things like that. So you know, that's that's like.

546
01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:22.759
Melissa: that's like something that I want to take. Seriously, as I'm trying to build things out. I think like the 1st app I tried to build like my teacher was showing me how to do it. He was like, Yeah, I'm showing you how to do it. But this year it could. You know that someone can do like sequel injection and do some bad things? So I'm like, Oh, shit! I need to try to get up on it so I can know what I'm I'm I'm dealing with here. So

547
01:03:23.636 --> 01:03:35.500
Melissa: yeah, that's in between fighting my project and trying just to get certain support types to work correctly. The security layer draped over my head today. So I'm gonna have to keep that in mind as I go

548
01:03:43.330 --> 01:04:03.890
Meri Nova: No, this is great thanks for sharing Melissa. I think you're like already thinking in the production environment. You know, there's it's so cool that you're like 3 steps ahead already. But it's a good practice to keep that in mind. But we're still in the week 3, and I love that you're already thinking about it. We're trying to ship the Mvp.

549
01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:11.730
Meri Nova: Or what was the other name? Remember? The guest speaker mentioned Don. Not the Mvp. But maybe Hi, you know this, too.

550
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.690
Meri Nova: and

551
01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:14.749
Hai: Like minimum, lovable, something

552
01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.560
Meri Nova: Yeah, something else. So let's see.

553
01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.349
Ekta: Something sec or something

554
01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:20.730
Meri Nova: Yeah.

555
01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:22.970
Ekta: Alright. We'll give something, you know.

556
01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.409
Meri Nova: Yeah, that was, yeah, we should.

557
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.100
Meri Nova: Yeah. But

558
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:40.589
Meri Nova: Melissa, you're doing great if nobody else has any other questions. So we can wrap this office hours.

559
01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.960
Meri Nova: And

560
01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:55.100
Meri Nova: yeah, and we can. We'll see on demo day. I'm gonna put up the form for the progress or the homework, whatever you like to call it on Circle, and can't wait to see what you guys are building this week.

561
01:04:55.230 --> 01:05:24.073
Praveena Suresh: Hey, hey, Mary? I just had a quick question for Hi, and like, maybe it's like more rudimentary. Possibly I don't know, because I've not watched all the videos and like slowly watching them and then trying to build on the side. So I'm still like catching up. Maybe this is something which is already discussed. I don't know, but I just still just wanted to bring it up in case you know what different people are building different things right? I know. Hi gives them

562
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:50.780
Praveena Suresh: some kind of a guidance about. Oh, if you have to do this, do such and such Api, or whatever it may be the case. For example, I asked him a question. Oh, how do I extract text from Pdf. Then he told me to do Gemini Flash Api, and also ask it to give Markdown. So how do you develop that intuition? Maybe it's like a big question I was like, oh, how does he? How do you do that

563
01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:57.100
Hai: Yeah, I had the same question for my boss at my 1st job. And I think the context was that

564
01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:03.069
Hai: I had this really easy task to do, which was adding, like email to salesforce.

565
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:06.360
Hai: And I would spend like 2 days on it, not knowing what to do.

566
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:20.730
Hai: And then I I asked my boss, and he, like took like 2 seconds to go on salesforce documentation and find the exact doc to do it. And I was like, how did you do that? And he's like, well, I just had like 17 years of development experience.

567
01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.530
Hai: And I'm like, Okay, but then I think over time, my real. What I realized was that

568
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:33.700
Hai: you just start to solve like similar problems. And then you kind of like develop a mental model of like how to find answers.

569
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:42.149
Hai: So, for example, whatever problems you throw at me now, I have like a problem solving framework where I'm like, okay, do I know everything that you're talking about.

570
01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:50.500
Hai: Maybe there's a part that I understand. I try to like preliminary Google that just to understand what's going on. And then

571
01:06:50.850 --> 01:07:02.310
Hai: I have a mental model of like, is this like an SDK? Is this like code, or is this like a concept or like? What is this? And then I'll try to look for sources that way. I think if you just expose yourself to a lot of different

572
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:05.309
Hai: types of technical challenges, you will

573
01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:20.190
Hai: develop the like an intuition to solve certain problems. Because everything that you guys asked me in this call. I I've I've worked on like at least maybe like 70% of the all those things. So I can kind of pull from my personal experience.

574
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:35.209
Hai: that's why you guys sucked out because you got this guy who has been working for real and not like, you know this, that saying like those who can't do, teach, do those who teach? I wouldn't say that. But like

575
01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:37.870
Hai: it's I don't know like

576
01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:45.689
Hai: it's I. We want this to be kind of like how you would sit next to your coworker at work and like ask whatever. So.

577
01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:52.059
Hai: of course, the coworker has to be doing work to know how to answer these questions, and I would hopefully answer those questions the way

578
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:59.120
Hai: a coworker would do to you when you know we're sitting next together next to each other at at a cubicle.

579
01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:02.980
Hai: instead of having giving you a lecture about how to do so.

580
01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:06.579
Hai: Sure, yeah. So I guess it just comes to time

581
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:26.879
Praveena Suresh: Okay, yeah, thank you. That answers my question. I mean, that's what I thought it is. But then I just wanted to know if there is anything you wanted to say. Also, I'm I'm hoping that, as I said, I didn't watch all the videos once you watch all those videos and try it. Maybe you start to develop, at least begin to develop is what I'm I'm thinking. Maybe the

582
01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.132
Hai: Yeah, I think.

583
01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:33.310
Hai: I think there were a few people who show up consistently to all of the coding streams.

584
01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:41.150
Hai: and they just sub subconsciously picked up on how I go about solving problems because we run into problems all the time on the on the stream

585
01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:42.269
Praveena Suresh: All the time

586
01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:43.429
Oren: That's the best thing

587
01:08:43.750 --> 01:09:05.459
Praveena Suresh: I. The reason I'm not able to like I have to. I mean, I have a long like work day, plus I'm trying to watch it not just once, a few times, because I know what you did. And I also try to do it by myself, not just watching like a movie, you know. So that I think time. Okay, that answers my question. Thank you.

588
01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:15.019
Hai: Yeah, I think I think for me it was looking at my boss problem solved. And I hope that for you guys, it would like, look at me going into issues and then trying to solve my own issues.

589
01:09:15.559 --> 01:09:37.919
Hai: I think, I hope, that you guys pick up on stuff like you know me going. I don't think I would pull up, stack, overflow even once, not even once. Always go directly to the to docs, always trying to read stuff, or if if I'm too tired, I'll be like, Okay, cursor. Solve this for me, or if there's already a pattern before then I'm like, Okay, cursor follow the same pattern and do the same here. So

590
01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:47.530
Hai: yeah, I think seeing somebody going through problem solving in real time is has been in my life has been tremendously useful, whether that's a coworker or a boss

591
01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:48.943
Hai: or somebody.

592
01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:57.489
Hai: Because when you go on Youtube, you watch a tutorial, it's always almost perfectly like from end to end, and real life is never like that.

593
01:09:57.610 --> 01:10:02.630
Hai: But, you know, seeing somebody struggle a little bit, I think, gives you permission to struggle and

594
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.359
Hai: work through things so

595
01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.049
Praveena Suresh: You know.

596
01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:16.530
Hai: Yeah. Somebody else can say how they problem solve. That'll be useful for other people.

597
01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:34.060
Hai: I'm like curious how autumn knows all her know her all her stuff, because, like a lot of stuff that she mentions, that's the stuff that I know that I never told the class I'm like, how do you know all this stuff that you gotta tell everybody

598
01:10:34.980 --> 01:11:02.942
Autumn Hicks: Like what I read a lot of documentation just cause I I feel like I don't. I don't know. I've never used for cell or anything before a few weeks ago. So I would say at least like an hour a day. That sounds weird. But I just I'm just looking at the docs. So that's how I saw that. There was an update for the AI SDK, and I was like, Oh, I have to check that out. But but yeah, I'm I'm not a software developer. So

599
01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.560
Autumn Hicks: I just Google, a lot

600
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:11.729
Hai: Yeah. So, stuff like that big nerd alert, right? Like, who like reads documentation

601
01:11:12.308 --> 01:11:22.369
Hai: and then just like geeked out about oh, like a 4.2 update just came out. Holy shit, you know, all like Orin, or in like post updates about like what's happening in AI like all the time

602
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:33.889
Hai: that, and like these people don't feel like they're wasting their time doing that because they like it. So if you have something that you're really into you do more of it. Then you kind of almost like, have an intuition of like

603
01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:38.209
Hai: you have. You have a better mental model of like how things, work and stuff like that.

604
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.370
Hai: Thank you.

605
01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:40.870
Hai: Yeah.

606
01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:45.690
Praveena Suresh: Yeah, thank you. That's very helpful.

607
01:11:47.690 --> 01:12:07.020
Hai: cool. So before we wrap up. I have a question for you guys, so me and Mary, we're thinking about like getting Tas, because I know some of you guys are doing pretty well, and you know, we're like, Oh, maybe they can essentially teach to or like help out the class and whatever not just this class. By the way, like, we're thinking, some like potentially

608
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:11.150
Hai: process after this. So if you're interested in like doing ta stuff.

609
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.399
Hai: What today means is basically like, be like me.

610
01:12:14.778 --> 01:12:35.170
Hai: helping out the class. Be like Frederick, like just jumping in like helping people in chat and stuff like that, because obviously you have knowledge, and the best way to learn is to teach it. That's how I did my my most like food camp. I didn't know shit when I joined them. I'm like, yeah, I know, react. That was literally learning react as I'm teaching it. And then by the end, I know react. So

611
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:44.810
Hai: so teaching is a great way to like reinforce what you're learning. So if you're interested in this shoot me a marry a DM, there's there's no concrete plan yet, but we're

612
01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.650
Hai: we're really really excited about the idea of, like.

613
01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:53.950
Hai: you know, having our students from the 1st boot camp be like teaching, or something like that? I feel like that'd be cool idea.

614
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:54.850
Hai: So

615
01:12:54.850 --> 01:13:19.549
Meri Nova: Yes, guys message us, because I can see that you'll benefit a lot from this as well. And this is again a community that we're building. And I would love to see you guys in the future cohorts, maybe. And that's how that's what happens. You know, the superstars are the most active people. Consistent people end up doing something together, you know. And again, I think all of you guys have great potential

616
01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:22.020
Hai: Yeah, so the path goes like this,

617
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:29.069
Hai: owning running airbnbs, or like, be a data scientist or data analyst somewhere.

618
01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:36.620
Hai: and then join this bootcamp. Learn how to ship stuff, build AI product engineering, and then be a ta

619
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:39.350
Hai: and then be a correct engineer at the end.

620
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:43.709
Hai: so you can't skip the ta part. You have to be a ta before we become a crack engineer.

621
01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:48.300
Hai: and then you go work for a startup or something. Everyone else

622
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:54.829
Meri Nova: Either startup or ta. I don't know, because you could be building internal tools, too. You know, we have so many like

623
01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:58.470
Meri Nova: things inside that we need to automate like even this.

624
01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:28.160
Meri Nova: And they're recording things. But but yeah, yeah, let us let us know. And we're we're thinking of. It's not 100% sure. Yet we're thinking of organizing a hackathon, probably in a month or so, probably both online or San Francisco, but definitely online. And we would love any volunteers or anyone who would like to participate as like a leader? Or how do you say someone who helps manages things because it's going to be a lot.

625
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:28.890
Meri Nova: But yeah.

626
01:14:28.890 --> 01:14:32.519
Hai: People are going to be asking questions about the stuff that you guys have learned already. So

627
01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:36.957
Hai: it'd be great to have some help

628
01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:38.300
Meri Nova: Yeah.

629
01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:49.719
Hai: Okay, sick. I gotta. I gotta do some other stuff now. But autumn autumn says I'm in. And then Keisha said, Okay, 5. Coding be documentation cool.

630
01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.669
Hai: I don't. Which one are you in? You gotta you gotta DM. Mary or me about

631
01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:55.740
Meri Nova: Which one

632
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.933
Autumn Hicks: For sure. The hackathon sounds cool.

633
01:14:59.679 --> 01:15:02.479
Autumn Hicks: I don't know if I could teach anyone anything, but

634
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:05.140
Autumn Hicks: take it till you make it. I could see

635
01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:07.709
Hai: Yeah, once, several times.

636
01:15:09.064 --> 01:15:12.780
Meri Nova: Love it. Lauren's 90% in in what

637
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:18.340
Oren: In a month, but we'll see. I mean we'll get to it

638
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:22.460
Meri Nova: Right, awesome.

639
01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:24.510
Hai: Alright gang.

640
01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.470
Hai: I'll see y'all tomorrow.

641
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:31.906
Meri Nova: I love this thing

642
01:15:32.670 --> 01:15:33.830
Oren: It is a boot camp

643
01:15:35.311 --> 01:15:42.540
Meri Nova: Oh, guys, let me take a screenshot that is so cool. Wait. Wait.

644
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:44.850
Meri Nova: Okay. How can I do both?

645
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:55.934
Meri Nova: Alright. Alright! 1, 2 I can do with one hand. Right, 1, 2, 3 awesome

646
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.350
Hai: Wait! Take it one more time. One more time.

647
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.870
