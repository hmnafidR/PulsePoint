I got notified just right now of a LinkedIn Learning course:

https://www.linkedin.com/learning/agentic-ai-fundamentals-architectures-frameworks-and-applications

Fun fact, Linkedin Learning had approached me about creating this Agentic course. 

But I decided to run this bootcamp w Hai instead.   🙂

00:50:36	Athira Praveen:	This is what I was looking for ! Haha dint even know this existed.
00:51:05	Oren:	I was literally working with AI Studio without realizing it’s right there.
00:51:06	Gil:	I’m giving the model the JSON spec within a prompt template. Probably not a reliable approach.
00:51:17	Praveena Suresh:	Yes I tried Hai!
00:51:20	Gil:	I did, pretty cool tool.
